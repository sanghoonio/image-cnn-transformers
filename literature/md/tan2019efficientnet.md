Abstract

Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are
commonly developed at a ﬁxed resource budget,
and then scaled up for better accuracy if more

resources are available.
tematically study model scaling and identify that
carefully balancing network depth, width, and res-
olution can lead to better performance. Based
on this observation, we propose a new scaling
method that uniformly scales all dimensions of
depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly
effective compound coefﬁcient. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this method on scaling up
MobileNets and ResNet.

To go even further, we use neural architec-
ture search to design a new baseline network
and scale it up to obtain a family of models,
called EfﬁcientNets, which achieve much
better accuracy and efﬁciency than previous
ConvNets.
In particular, our EfﬁcientNet-B7
achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and
6.1x faster on inference than the best existing
ConvNet. Our EfﬁcientNets also transfer well and
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100
(91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer
learning datasets, with an order of magnitude
fewer parameters. Source code is at https:

1. Introduction

Scaling up ConvNets is widely used to achieve better accu-
racy. For example, ResNet (He et al., 2016) can be scaled
up from ResNet-18 to ResNet-200 by using more layers;
Recently, GPipe (Huang et al., 2018) achieved 84.3% Ima-
geNet top-1 accuracy by scaling up a baseline model four

perform other ConvNets. In particular, EfﬁcientNet-B7 achieves

and 6.1x faster than GPipe. EfﬁcientNet-B1 is 7.6x smaller and

time larger. However, the process of scaling up ConvNets
has never been well understood and there are currently many
ways to do it. The most common way is to scale up Con-
vNets by their depth (He et al., 2016) or width (Zagoruyko &
Komodakis, 2016). Another less common, but increasingly
popular, method is to scale up models by image resolution
(Huang et al., 2018). In previous work, it is common to scale
only one of the three dimensions – depth, width, and image
size. Though it is possible to scale two or three dimensions
arbitrarily, arbitrary scaling requires tedious manual tuning
and still often yields sub-optimal accuracy and efﬁciency.

In this paper, we want to study and rethink the process
of scaling up ConvNets. In particular, we investigate the
central question: is there a principled method to scale up
ConvNets that can achieve better accuracy and efﬁciency?
Our empirical study shows that it is critical to balance all
dimensions of network width/depth/resolution, and surpris-
ingly such balance can be achieved by simply scaling each
of them with constant ratio. Based on this observation, we
propose a simple yet effective compound scaling method.
Unlike conventional practice that arbitrary scales these fac-
tors, our method uniformly scales network width, depth,

and resolution with a set of ﬁxed scaling coefﬁcients. For
example, if we want to use 2N times more computational
resources, then we can simply increase the network depth by
αN , width by βN , and image size by γN , where α, β, γ are
constant coefﬁcients determined by a small grid search on
the original small model. Figure 2 illustrates the difference
between our scaling method and conventional methods.

Intuitively, the compound scaling method makes sense be-
cause if the input image is bigger, then the network needs
more layers to increase the receptive ﬁeld and more channels
to capture more ﬁne-grained patterns on the bigger image. In
fact, previous theoretical (Raghu et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018)
and empirical results (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) both
show that there exists certain relationship between network
width and depth, but to our best knowledge, we are the
ﬁrst to empirically quantify the relationship among all three
dimensions of network width, depth, and resolution.

We demonstrate that our scaling method work well on exist-
ing MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017; Sandler et al., 2018)
and ResNet (He et al., 2016). Notably, the effectiveness of
model scaling heavily depends on the baseline network; to
go even further, we use neural architecture search (Zoph
& Le, 2017; Tan et al., 2019) to develop a new baseline
network, and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called
EfﬁcientNets. Figure 1 summarizes the ImageNet perfor-
mance, where our EfﬁcientNets signiﬁcantly outperform
other ConvNets. In particular, our EfﬁcientNet-B7 surpasses
the best existing GPipe accuracy (Huang et al., 2018), but
using 8.4x fewer parameters and running 6.1x faster on in-
ference. Compared to the widely used ResNet-50 (He et al.,
2016), our EfﬁcientNet-B4 improves the top-1 accuracy
from 76.3% to 83.0% (+6.7%) with similar FLOPS. Besides
ImageNet, EfﬁcientNets also transfer well and achieve state-

of-the-art accuracy on 5 out of 8 widely used datasets, while
reducing parameters by up to 21x than existing ConvNets.

2. Related Work

ConvNet Accuracy: Since AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al.,
2012) won the 2012 ImageNet competition, ConvNets have
become increasingly more accurate by going bigger: while
the 2014 ImageNet winner GoogleNet (Szegedy et al., 2015)
achieves 74.8% top-1 accuracy with about 6.8M parameters,
the 2017 ImageNet winner SENet (Hu et al., 2018) achieves
82.7% top-1 accuracy with 145M parameters. Recently,
GPipe (Huang et al., 2018) further pushes the state-of-the-art
ImageNet top-1 validation accuracy to 84.3% using 557M
parameters: it is so big that it can only be trained with a
specialized pipeline parallelism library by partitioning the
network and spreading each part to a different accelera-
tor. While these models are mainly designed for ImageNet,
recent studies have shown better ImageNet models also per-
form better across a variety of transfer learning datasets
(Kornblith et al., 2019), and other computer vision tasks
such as object detection (He et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019).
Although higher accuracy is critical for many applications,
we have already hit the hardware memory limit, and thus
further accuracy gain needs better efﬁciency.

ConvNet Efﬁciency: Deep ConvNets are often over-
parameterized. Model compression (Han et al., 2016; He
et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018) is a common way to re-
duce model size by trading accuracy for efﬁciency. As mo-
bile phones become ubiquitous, it is also common to hand-
craft efﬁcient mobile-size ConvNets, such as SqueezeNets
(Iandola et al., 2016; Gholami et al., 2018), MobileNets
(Howard et al., 2017; Sandler et al., 2018), and ShufﬂeNets

(Zhang et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018). Recently, neural archi-
tecture search becomes increasingly popular in designing
efﬁcient mobile-size ConvNets (Tan et al., 2019; Cai et al.,
2019), and achieves even better efﬁciency than hand-crafted
mobile ConvNets by extensively tuning the network width,
depth, convolution kernel types and sizes. However, it is
unclear how to apply these techniques for larger models that
have much larger design space and much more expensive
tuning cost. In this paper, we aim to study model efﬁciency
for super large ConvNets that surpass state-of-the-art accu-
racy. To achieve this goal, we resort to model scaling.

Model Scaling: There are many ways to scale a Con-
vNet for different resource constraints: ResNet (He et al.,
2016) can be scaled down (e.g., ResNet-18) or up (e.g.,
ResNet-200) by adjusting network depth (#layers), while
WideResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) and Mo-
bileNets (Howard et al., 2017) can be scaled by network
width (#channels). It is also well-recognized that bigger
input image size will help accuracy with the overhead of
more FLOPS. Although prior studies (Raghu et al., 2017;
Lin & Jegelka, 2018; Sharir & Shashua, 2018; Lu et al.,
2018) have shown that network depth and width are both
important for ConvNets’ expressive power, it still remains
an open question of how to effectively scale a ConvNet to
achieve better efﬁciency and accuracy. Our work systemati-
cally and empirically studies ConvNet scaling for all three
dimensions of network width, depth, and resolutions.

i. Figure 2(a) illustrate a representative ConvNet, where
the spatial dimension is gradually shrunk but the channel
dimension is expanded over layers, for example, from initial
input shape (cid:104)224, 224, 3(cid:105) to ﬁnal output shape (cid:104)7, 7, 512(cid:105).

Unlike regular ConvNet designs that mostly focus on ﬁnd-
ing the best layer architecture Fi, model scaling tries to ex-
pand the network length (Li), width (Ci), and/or resolution
(Hi, Wi) without changing Fi predeﬁned in the baseline
network. By ﬁxing Fi, model scaling simpliﬁes the design
problem for new resource constraints, but it still remains
a large design space to explore different Li, Ci, Hi, Wi for
each layer. In order to further reduce the design space, we
restrict that all layers must be scaled uniformly with con-
stant ratio. Our target is to maximize the model accuracy
for any given resource constraints, which can be formulated
as an optimization problem:

where w, d, r are coefﬁcients for scaling network width,
depth, and resolution; ˆFi, ˆLi, ˆHi, ˆWi, ˆCi are predeﬁned pa-
rameters in baseline network (see Table 1 as an example).

3. Compound Model Scaling

3.2. Scaling Dimensions

In this section, we will formulate the scaling problem, study
different approaches, and propose our new scaling method.

3.1. Problem Formulation

A ConvNet Layer i can be deﬁned as a function: Yi =
Fi(Xi), where Fi is the operator, Yi is output tensor, Xi is
input tensor, with tensor shape (cid:104)Hi, Wi, Ci(cid:105)1, where Hi and
Wi are spatial dimension and Ci is the channel dimension.
A ConvNet N can be represented by a list of composed lay-
ers: N = Fk (cid:12) ... (cid:12) F2 (cid:12) F1(X1) = (cid:74)
j=1...k Fj(X1). In
practice, ConvNet layers are often partitioned into multiple
stages and all layers in each stage share the same architec-
ture: for example, ResNet (He et al., 2016) has ﬁve stages,
and all layers in each stage has the same convolutional type
except the ﬁrst layer performs down-sampling. Therefore,
we can deﬁne a ConvNet as:

(cid:75)

N =

F Li
i

(cid:0)X(cid:104)Hi,Wi,Ci(cid:105)

(cid:1)

(1)

i=1...s

where F Li
i denotes layer Fi is repeated Li times in stage i,
(cid:104)Hi, Wi, Ci(cid:105) denotes the shape of input tensor X of layer

1For the sake of simplicity, we omit batch dimension.

The main difﬁculty of problem 2 is that the optimal d, w, r
depend on each other and the values change under different
resource constraints. Due to this difﬁculty, conventional
methods mostly scale ConvNets in one of these dimensions:

Depth (ddd): Scaling network depth is the most common way
used by many ConvNets (He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017;
Szegedy et al., 2015; 2016). The intuition is that deeper
ConvNet can capture richer and more complex features, and
generalize well on new tasks. However, deeper networks
are also more difﬁcult to train due to the vanishing gradient
problem (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). Although sev-
eral techniques, such as skip connections (He et al., 2016)
and batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), alleviate
the training problem, the accuracy gain of very deep network
diminishes: for example, ResNet-1000 has similar accuracy
as ResNet-101 even though it has much more layers. Figure
3 (middle) shows our empirical study on scaling a baseline
model with different depth coefﬁcient d, further suggesting
the diminishing accuracy return for very deep ConvNets.

Width (www): Scaling network width is commonly used for
small size models (Howard et al., 2017; Sandler et al., 2018;

EfﬁcientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks

Figure 3. Scaling Up a Baseline Model with Different Network Width (w), Depth (d), and Resolution (r) Coefﬁcients. Bigger
networks with larger width, depth, or resolution tend to achieve higher accuracy, but the accuracy gain quickly saturate after reaching
80%, demonstrating the limitation of single dimension scaling. Baseline network is described in Table 1.

Tan et al., 2019)2. As discussed in (Zagoruyko & Ko-
modakis, 2016), wider networks tend to be able to capture
more ﬁne-grained features and are easier to train. However,
extremely wide but shallow networks tend to have difﬁcul-
ties in capturing higher level features. Our empirical results
in Figure 3 (left) show that the accuracy quickly saturates
when networks become much wider with larger w.

Resolution (rrr): With higher resolution input images, Con-
vNets can potentially capture more ﬁne-grained patterns.
Starting from 224x224 in early ConvNets, modern Con-
vNets tend to use 299x299 (Szegedy et al., 2016) or 331x331
(Zoph et al., 2018) for better accuracy. Recently, GPipe
(Huang et al., 2018) achieves state-of-the-art ImageNet ac-
curacy with 480x480 resolution. Higher resolutions, such as
600x600, are also widely used in object detection ConvNets
(He et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017). Figure 3 (right) shows the
results of scaling network resolutions, where indeed higher
resolutions improve accuracy, but the accuracy gain dimin-
ishes for very high resolutions (r = 1.0 denotes resolution
224x224 and r = 2.5 denotes resolution 560x560).

The above analyses lead us to the ﬁrst observation:

Observation 1 – Scaling up any dimension of network
width, depth, or resolution improves accuracy, but the accu-
racy gain diminishes for bigger models.

3.3. Compound Scaling

We empirically observe that different scaling dimensions are
not independent. Intuitively, for higher resolution images,
we should increase network depth, such that the larger re-
ceptive ﬁelds can help capture similar features that include
more pixels in bigger images. Correspondingly, we should
also increase network width when resolution is higher, in

2In some literature, scaling number of channels is called “depth

multiplier”, which means the same as our width coefﬁcient w.

Figure 4. Scaling Network Width for Different Baseline Net-
works. Each dot in a line denotes a model with different width
coefﬁcient (w). All baseline networks are from Table 1. The ﬁrst
baseline network (d=1.0, r=1.0) has 18 convolutional layers with
resolution 224x224, while the last baseline (d=2.0, r=1.3) has 36
layers with resolution 299x299.

order to capture more ﬁne-grained patterns with more pixels
in high resolution images. These intuitions suggest that we
need to coordinate and balance different scaling dimensions
rather than conventional single-dimension scaling.

To validate our intuitions, we compare width scaling under
different network depths and resolutions, as shown in Figure
4.
If we only scale network width w without changing
depth (d=1.0) and resolution (r=1.0), the accuracy saturates
quickly. With deeper (d=2.0) and higher resolution (r=2.0),
width scaling achieves much better accuracy under the same
FLOPS cost. These results lead us to the second observation:

Observation 2 – In order to pursue better accuracy and
efﬁciency, it is critical to balance all dimensions of network
width, depth, and resolution during ConvNet scaling.

In fact, a few prior work (Zoph et al., 2018; Real et al., 2019)
have already tried to arbitrarily balance network width and
depth, but they all require tedious manual tuning.

Table 1. EfﬁcientNet-B0 baseline network – Each row describes
a stage i with ˆLi layers, with input resolution (cid:104) ˆHi, ˆWi(cid:105) and output
channels ˆCi. Notations are adopted from equation 2.

In this paper, we propose a new compound scaling method,
which use a compound coefﬁcient φ to uniformly scales
network width, depth, and resolution in a principled way:

depth: d = αφ
width: w = βφ
resolution: r = γφ

s.t. α · β2 · γ2 ≈ 2

α ≥ 1, β ≥ 1, γ ≥ 1

(3)

where α, β, γ are constants that can be determined by a
small grid search. Intuitively, φ is a user-speciﬁed coefﬁ-
cient that controls how many more resources are available
for model scaling, while α, β, γ specify how to assign these
extra resources to network width, depth, and resolution re-
spectively. Notably, the FLOPS of a regular convolution op
is proportional to d, w2, r2, i.e., doubling network depth
will double FLOPS, but doubling network width or resolu-
tion will increase FLOPS by four times. Since convolution
ops usually dominate the computation cost in ConvNets,
scaling a ConvNet with equation 3 will approximately in-
crease total FLOPS by (cid:0)α · β2 · γ2(cid:1)φ
. In this paper, we
constraint α · β2 · γ2 ≈ 2 such that for any new φ, the total
FLOPS will approximately3 increase by 2φ.

4. EfﬁcientNet Architecture
Since model scaling does not change layer operators ˆFi
in baseline network, having a good baseline network is
also critical. We will evaluate our scaling method using
existing ConvNets, but in order to better demonstrate the
effectiveness of our scaling method, we have also developed
a new mobile-size baseline, called EfﬁcientNet.

Inspired by (Tan et al., 2019), we develop our baseline net-
work by leveraging a multi-objective neural architecture
search that optimizes both accuracy and FLOPS. Speciﬁ-
cally, we use the same search space as (Tan et al., 2019),
and use ACC(m)×[F LOP S(m)/T ]w as the optimization
goal, where ACC(m) and F LOP S(m) denote the accu-
racy and FLOPS of model m, T is the target FLOPS and
w=-0.07 is a hyperparameter for controlling the trade-off
between accuracy and FLOPS. Unlike (Tan et al., 2019;
Cai et al., 2019), here we optimize FLOPS rather than la-
tency since we are not targeting any speciﬁc hardware de-
vice. Our search produces an efﬁcient network, which we
name EfﬁcientNet-B0. Since we use the same search space
as (Tan et al., 2019), the architecture is similar to Mnas-

3FLOPS may differ from theoretical value due to rounding.

Net, except our EfﬁcientNet-B0 is slightly bigger due to
the larger FLOPS target (our FLOPS target is 400M). Ta-
ble 1 shows the architecture of EfﬁcientNet-B0. Its main
building block is mobile inverted bottleneck MBConv (San-
dler et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019), to which we also add
squeeze-and-excitation optimization (Hu et al., 2018).

Starting from the baseline EfﬁcientNet-B0, we apply our
compound scaling method to scale it up with two steps:

• STEP 1: we ﬁrst ﬁx φ = 1, assuming twice more re-
sources available, and do a small grid search of α, β, γ
In particular, we ﬁnd
based on Equation 2 and 3.
the best values for EfﬁcientNet-B0 are α = 1.2, β =
1.1, γ = 1.15, under constraint of α · β2 · γ2 ≈ 2.
• STEP 2: we then ﬁx α, β, γ as constants and scale up
baseline network with different φ using Equation 3, to
obtain EfﬁcientNet-B1 to B7 (Details in Table 2).

Notably, it is possible to achieve even better performance by
searching for α, β, γ directly around a large model, but the
search cost becomes prohibitively more expensive on larger
models. Our method solves this issue by only doing search
once on the small baseline network (step 1), and then use
the same scaling coefﬁcients for all other models (step 2).

5. Experiments

In this section, we will ﬁrst evaluate our scaling method on
existing ConvNets and the new proposed EfﬁcientNets.

5.1. Scaling Up MobileNets and ResNets

As a proof of concept, we ﬁrst apply our scaling method
to the widely-used MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017; San-
dler et al., 2018) and ResNet (He et al., 2016). Table 3
shows the ImageNet results of scaling them in different
ways. Compared to other single-dimension scaling methods,
our compound scaling method improves the accuracy on all
these models, suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed
scaling method for general existing ConvNets.

Table 2. EfﬁcientNet Performance Results on ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015). All EfﬁcientNet models are scaled from our
baseline EfﬁcientNet-B0 using different compound coefﬁcient φ in Equation 3. ConvNets with similar top-1/top-5 accuracy are grouped
together for efﬁciency comparison. Our scaled EfﬁcientNet models consistently reduce parameters and FLOPS by an order of magnitude
(up to 8.4x parameter reduction and up to 16x FLOPS reduction) than existing ConvNets.

weight decay 1e-5; initial learning rate 0.256 that decays
by 0.97 every 2.4 epochs. We also use SiLU (Swish-1) ac-
tivation (Ramachandran et al., 2018; Elfwing et al., 2018;
Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016), AutoAugment (Cubuk et al.,
2019), and stochastic depth (Huang et al., 2016) with sur-
vival probability 0.8. As commonly known that bigger mod-
els need more regularization, we linearly increase dropout
(Srivastava et al., 2014) ratio from 0.2 for EfﬁcientNet-B0 to
0.5 for B7. We reserve 25K randomly picked images from
the training set as a minival set, and perform early
stopping on this minival; we then evaluate the early-
stopped checkpoint on the original validation set to
report the ﬁnal validation accuracy.

Table 2 shows the performance of all EfﬁcientNet models
that are scaled from the same baseline EfﬁcientNet-B0. Our
EfﬁcientNet models generally use an order of magnitude
fewer parameters and FLOPS than other ConvNets with
similar accuracy. In particular, our EfﬁcientNet-B7 achieves
84.3% top1 accuracy with 66M parameters and 37B FLOPS,

being more accurate but 8.4x smaller than the previous
best GPipe (Huang et al., 2018). These gains come from
both better architectures, better scaling, and better training
settings that are customized for EfﬁcientNet.

Figure 1 and Figure 5 illustrates the parameters-accuracy
and FLOPS-accuracy curve for representative ConvNets,
where our scaled EfﬁcientNet models achieve better accu-
racy with much fewer parameters and FLOPS than other
ConvNets. Notably, our EfﬁcientNet models are not only
small, but also computational cheaper. For example, our
EfﬁcientNet-B3 achieves higher accuracy than ResNeXt-
101 (Xie et al., 2017) using 18x fewer FLOPS.

To validate the latency, we have also measured the inference
latency for a few representative CovNets on a real CPU as
shown in Table 4, where we report average latency over
20 runs. Our EfﬁcientNet-B1 runs 5.7x faster than the
widely used ResNet-152, while EfﬁcientNet-B7 runs about
6.1x faster than GPipe (Huang et al., 2018), suggesting our
EfﬁcientNets are indeed fast on real hardware.

5.3. Transfer Learning Results for EfﬁcientNet

We have also evaluated our EfﬁcientNet on a list of com-
monly used transfer learning datasets, as shown in Table
6. We borrow the same training settings from (Kornblith
et al., 2019) and (Huang et al., 2018), which take ImageNet
pretrained checkpoints and ﬁnetune on new datasets.

Table 5 shows the transfer learning performance: (1) Com-
pared to public available models, such as NASNet-A (Zoph
et al., 2018) and Inception-v4 (Szegedy et al., 2017), our Ef-
ﬁcientNet models achieve better accuracy with 4.7x average
(up to 21x) parameter reduction. (2) Compared to state-
of-the-art models, including DAT (Ngiam et al., 2018) that
dynamically synthesizes training data and GPipe (Huang
et al., 2018) that is trained with specialized pipeline paral-
lelism, our EfﬁcientNet models still surpass their accuracy
in 5 out of 8 datasets, but using 9.6x fewer parameters

Figure 6 compares the accuracy-parameters curve for a va-
riety of models. In general, our EfﬁcientNets consistently
achieve better accuracy with an order of magnitude fewer pa-
rameters than existing models, including ResNet (He et al.,
2016), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017), Inception (Szegedy
et al., 2017), and NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018).

6. Discussion

To disentangle the contribution of our proposed scaling
method from the EfﬁcientNet architecture, Figure 8 com-
pares the ImageNet performance of different scaling meth-

ods for the same EfﬁcientNet-B0 baseline network. In gen-
eral, all scaling methods improve accuracy with the cost
of more FLOPS, but our compound scaling method can
further improve accuracy, by up to 2.5%, than other single-
dimension scaling methods, suggesting the importance of
our proposed compound scaling.

In order to further understand why our compound scaling
method is better than others, Figure 7 compares the class
activation map (Zhou et al., 2016) for a few representative
models with different scaling methods. All these models are
scaled from the same baseline, and their statistics are shown
in Table 7. Images are randomly picked from ImageNet
validation set. As shown in the ﬁgure, the model with com-
pound scaling tends to focus on more relevant regions with
more object details, while other models are either lack of
object details or unable to capture all objects in the images.

7. Conclusion

In this paper, we systematically study ConvNet scaling and
identify that carefully balancing network width, depth, and
resolution is an important but missing piece, preventing us
from better accuracy and efﬁciency. To address this issue,
we propose a simple and highly effective compound scaling
method, which enables us to easily scale up a baseline Con-
vNet to any target resource constraints in a more principled
way, while maintaining model efﬁciency. Powered by this
compound scaling method, we demonstrate that a mobile-
size EfﬁcientNet model can be scaled up very effectively,
surpassing state-of-the-art accuracy with an order of magni-
tude fewer parameters and FLOPS, on both ImageNet and
ﬁve commonly used transfer learning datasets.

Appendix

Since 2017, most research papers only report and compare
ImageNet validation accuracy; this paper also follows this
convention for better comparison.
In addition, we have
also veriﬁed the test accuracy by submitting our predictions
on the 100k test set images to http://image-net.org;
results are in Table 8. As expected, the test accuracy is very
close to the validation accuracy.
