Abstract

Transformers have attracted increasing interests in computer vision, but they still
fall behind state-of-the-art convolutional networks. In this work, we show that
while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be
worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To
effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets
(pronounced “coat” nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights:
(1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally uniﬁed via simple
relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in
a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and
efﬁciency. Experiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art perfor-
mance under different resource constraints across various datasets: Without extra
data, CoAtNet achieves 86.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy; When pre-trained with
13M images from ImageNet-21K, our CoAtNet achieves 88.56% top-1 accuracy,
matching ViT-huge pre-trained with 300M images from JFT-300M while using
23x less data; Notably, when we further scale up CoAtNet with JFT-3B, it achieves
90.88% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.

Introduction

Since the breakthrough of AlexNet [1], Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have been the
dominating model architecture for computer vision [2, 3, 4, 5]. Meanwhile, with the success of
self-attention models like Transformers [6] in natural language processing [7, 8], many previous
works have attempted to bring in the power of attention into computer vision [9, 10, 11, 12]. More
recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) [13] has shown that with almost1 only vanilla Transformer layers,
one could obtain reasonable performance on ImageNet-1K [14] alone. More importantly, when
pre-trained on large-scale weakly labeled JFT-300M dataset [15], ViT achieves comparable results
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConvNets, indicating that Transformer models potentially have higher
capacity at scale than ConvNets.

While ViT has shown impressive results with enormous JFT 300M training images, its performance
still falls behind ConvNets in the low data regime. For example, without extra JFT-300M pre-training,
the ImageNet accuracy of ViT is still signiﬁcantly lower than ConvNets with comparable model
size [5] (see Table 13). Subsequent works use special regularization and stronger data augmentation
to improve the vanilla ViT [16, 17, 18], yet none of these ViT variants could outperform the SOTA
convolution-only models on ImageNet classiﬁcation given the same amount of data and computa-
tion [19, 20]. This suggests that vanilla Transformer layers may lack certain desirable inductive biases
possessed by ConvNets, and thus require signiﬁcant amount of data and computational resource
to compensate. Not surprisingly, many recent works have been trying to incorporate the induc-
tive biases of ConvNets into Transformer models, by imposing local receptive ﬁelds for attention

layers [21, 22] or augmenting the attention and FFN layers with implicit or explicit convolutional
operations [23, 24, 25]. However, these approaches are either ad-hoc or focused on injecting a
particular property, lacking a systematic understanding of the respective roles of convolution and
attention when combined.

In this work, we systematically study the problem of hybridizing convolution and attention from
two fundamental aspects in machine learning – generalization and model capacity. Our study shows
that convolutional layers tend to have better generalization with faster converging speed thanks to
their strong prior of inductive bias, while attention layers have higher model capacity that can beneﬁt
from larger datasets. Combining convolutional and attention layers can achieve better generalization
and capacity; however, a key challenge here is how to effectively combine them to achieve better
trade-offs between accuracy and efﬁciency. In this paper, we investigate two key insights: First, we
observe that the commonly used depthwise convolution can be effectively merged into attention
layers with simple relative attention; Second, simply stacking convolutional and attention layers, in a
proper way, could be surprisingly effective to achieve better generalization and capacity. Based on
these insights, we propose a simple yet effective network architecture named CoAtNet, which enjoys
the strengths from both ConvNets and Transformers.

Our CoAtNet achieves SOTA performances under comparable resource constraints across different
data sizes. Speciﬁcally, under the low-data regime, CoAtNet inherits the great generalization property
of ConvNets thanks to the favorable inductive biases. Moreover, given abundant data, CoAtNet not
only enjoys the superior scalability of Transformer models, but also achieves faster convergence and
thus improved efﬁciency. When only ImageNet-1K is used for training, CoAtNet achieves 86.0%
top-1 accuracy, matching the prior art NFNet [20] under similar computation resource and training
conditions. Further, when pre-trained on ImageNet-21K with about 10M images, CoAtNet reaches
88.56% top-1 accuracy when ﬁnetuned on ImageNet-1K, matching the ViT-Huge pre-trained on
JFT-300M, a 23× larger dataset. Finally, when JFT-3B is used for pre-training, CoAtNet exhibits
better efﬁciency compared to ViT, and pushes the ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy to 90.88% while
using 1.5x less computation of the prior art set by ViT-G/14 [26].

2 Model

In the section, we focus on the question of how to “optimally” combine the convolution and trans-
former. Roughly speaking, we decompose the question into two parts:

1. How to combine the convolution and self-attention within one basic computational block?

2. How to vertically stack different types of computational blocks together to form a complete

network?

The rationale of the decomposition will become clearer as we gradually reveal our design choices.

2.1 Merging Convolution and Self-Attention

For convolution, we mainly focus on the MBConv block [27] which employs depthwise convolu-
tion [28] to capture the spatial interaction. A key reason of this choice is that both the FFN module
in Transformer and MBConv employ the design of “inverted bottleneck”, which ﬁrst expands the
channel size of the input by 4x and later project the the 4x-wide hidden state back to the original
channel size to enable residual connection.

Besides the similarity of inverted bottleneck, we also notice that both depthwise convolution and
self-attention can be expressed as a per-dimension weighted sum of values in a pre-deﬁned receptive
ﬁeld. Speciﬁcally, convolution relies on a ﬁxed kernel to gather information from a local receptive
ﬁeld

(depthwise convolution),

where xi, yi ∈ RD are the input and output at position i respectively, and L(i) denotes a local
neighborhood of i, e.g., a 3x3 grid centered at i in image processing.

In comparison, self-attention allows the receptive ﬁeld to be the entire spatial locations and computes
the weights based on the re-normalized pairwise similarity between the pair (xi, xj):2

where G indicates the global spatial space. Before getting into the question of how to best combine
them, it is worthwhile to compare their relative strengths and weaknesses, which helps to ﬁgure out
the good properties we hope to retain.

• First of all, the depthwise convolution kernel wi−j is an input-independent parameter of static value,
while the attention weight Ai,j dynamically depends on the representation of the input. Hence, it is
much easier for the self-attention to capture complicated relational interactions between different
spatial positions, a property that we desire most when processing high-level concepts. However,
the ﬂexibility comes with a risk of easier overﬁtting, especially when data is limited.

• Secondly, notice that given any position pair (i, j), the corresponding convolution weight wi−j only
cares about the relative shift between them, i.e. i − j, rather than the speciﬁc values of i or j. This
property is often referred to translation equivalence, which has been found to improve generalization
under datasets of limited size [29]. Due to the usage of absolution positional embeddings, standard
Transformer (ViT) lacks this property. This partially explains why ConvNets are usually better than
Transformers when the dataset is not enormously large.

• Finally, the size of the receptive ﬁeld is one of the most crucial differences between self-attention
and convolution. Generally speaking, a larger receptive ﬁeld provides more contextual information,
which could lead to higher model capacity. Hence, the global receptive ﬁeld has been a key
motivation to employ self-attention in vision. However, a large receptive ﬁeld requires signiﬁcantly
more computation. In the case of global attention, the complexity is quadratic w.r.t. spatial size,
which has been a fundamental trade-off in applying self-attention models.

Given the comparison above, an ideal model should be able to combine the 3 desirable properties in
Table 1. With the similar form of depthwise convolution in Eqn. (1) and self-attention in Eqn. (2), a
straightforward idea that could achieve this is simply to sum a global static convolution kernel with
the adaptive attention matrix, either after or before the Softmax normalization, i.e.,

(cid:80)

i xk + wi−k

(cid:1) xj. (3)

Interestingly, while the idea seems overly simpliﬁed, the pre-normalization version ypre corresponds
to a particular variant of relative self-attention [30, 31]. In this case, the attention weight Ai,j is
decided jointly by the wi−j of translation equivariance and the input-adaptive x(cid:62)
i xj, which can
enjoy both effects depending on their relative magnitudes. Importantly, note that in order to enable
the global convolution kernel without blowing up the number of parameters, we have reloaded the
notation of wi−j as a scalar (i.e., w ∈ RO(|G|)) rather than a vector in Eqn. (1). Another advantage of
the scalar formulation of w is that retrieving wi−j for all (i, j) is clearly subsumed by computing
the pairwise dot-product attention, hence resulting in minimum additional cost (see Appendix A.1).
Given the beneﬁts, we will use the Transformer block with the pre-normalization relative attention
variant in Eqn. (3) as the key component of the proposed CoAtNet model.

2To simplify the presentation, we deliberately omit the multi-head query, key and value projections for now.

In the actual implementation, we always use the multi-head projections.

2.2 Vertical Layout Design

After ﬁguring out a neat way to combine convolution and attention, we next consider how to utilize it
to stack an entire network.

As we have discuss above, the global context has a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the spatial size. Hence,
if we directly apply the relative attention in Eqn. (3) to the raw image input, the computation will
be excessively slow due to the large number of pixels in any image of common sizes. Hence, to
construct a network that is feasible in practice, we have mainly three options:

(A) Perform some down-sampling to reduce the spatial size and employ the global relative attention

after the feature map reaches manageable level.

(B) Enforce local attention, which restricts the global receptive ﬁeld G in attention to a local ﬁeld L

just like in convolution [22, 21].

(C) Replace the quadratic Softmax attention with certain linear attention variant which only has a

linear complexity w.r.t. the spatial size [12, 32, 33].

We brieﬂy experimented with option (C) without getting a reasonably good result. For option (B), we
found that implementing local attention involves many non-trivial shape formatting operations that
requires intensive memory access. On our accelerator of choice (TPU), such operation turns out to be
extremely slow [34], which not only defeats the original purpose of speeding up global attention, but
also hurts the model capacity. Hence, as some recent work has studied this variant [22, 21], we will
focus on option (A) and compare our results with theirs in our empirical study (Section 4).

For option (A), the down-sampling can be achieved by either (1) a convolution stem with aggressive
stride (e.g., stride 16x16) as in ViT or (2) a multi-stage network with gradual pooling as in ConvNets.
With these choices, we derive a search space of 5 variants and compare them in controlled experiments.

• When the ViT Stem is used, we directly stack L Transformer blocks with relative attention, which

we denote as VITREL.

• When the multi-stage layout is used, we mimic ConvNets to construct a network of 5 stages (S0,
S1, S2, S3 & S4), with spatial resolution gradually decreased from S0 to S4. At the beginning
of each stage, we always reduce the spatial size by 2x and increase the number of channels (see
Appendix A.1 for the detailed down-sampling implementation).
The ﬁrst stage S0 is a simple 2-layer convolutional Stem and S1 always employs MBConv blocks
with squeeze-excitation (SE), as the spatial size is too large for global attention. Starting from
S2 through S4, we consider either the MBConv or the Transformer block, with a constraint that
convolution stages must appear before Transformer stages. The constraint is based on the prior
that convolution is better at processing local patterns that are more common in early stages. This
leads to 4 variants with increasingly more Transformer stages, C-C-C-C, C-C-C-T, C-C-T-T and
C-T-T-T, where C and T denote Convolution and Transformer respectively.

To systematically study the design choices, we consider two fundamental aspects generalization
capability and model capacity: For generalization, we are interested in the gap between the training
loss and the evaluation accuracy. If two models have the same training loss, then the model with
higher evaluation accuracy has better generalization capability, since it can generalize better to unseen
evaluation dataset. Generalization capability is particularly important to data efﬁciency when training
data size is limited. For model capacity, we measure the ability to ﬁt large training datasets. When
training data is abundant and overﬁtting is not an issue, the model with higher capacity will achieve
better ﬁnal performance after reasonable training steps. Note that, since simply increasing the model
size can lead to higher model capacity, to perform a meaningful comparison, we make sure the model
sizes of the 5 variants are comparable.

To compare the generalization and model capacity, we train different variants of hybrid models on
ImageNet-1K (1.3M) and JFT (>300M) dataset for 300 and 3 epochs respectively, both without
any regularization or augmentation. The training loss and evaluation accuracy on both datasets are
summarized in Figure 1.

• From the ImageNet-1K results, a key observation is that, in terms of generalization capability (i.e.,

gap between train and evaluation metrics), we have

C-C-C-C ≈ C-C-C-T ≥ C-C-T-T > C-T-T-T (cid:29) VITREL.

(b) JFT

Figure 1: Comparison for model generalization and capacity under different data size. For fair
comparison, all models have similar parameter size and computational cost.

Particularly, VITREL is signiﬁcantly worse than variants by a large margin, which we conjecture
is related to the lack of proper low-level information processing in its aggressive down-sampling
Stem. Among the multi-stage variants, the overall trend is that the more convolution stages the
model has, the smaller the generalization gap is.

• As for model capacity, from the JFT comparison, both the train and evaluation metrics at the end

of the training suggest the following ranking:

C-C-T-T ≈ C-T-T-T > VITREL > C-C-C-T > C-C-C-C.

Importantly, this suggests that simply having more Transformer blocks does NOT necessarily
mean higher capacity for visual processing. On one hand, while initially worse, VITREL ultimately
catch up with the two variants with more MBConv stages, indicating the capacity advantage of
Transformer blocks. On the other hand, both C-C-T-T and C-T-T-T clearly outperforming VITREL
suggest that the ViT stem with an aggressive stride may have lost too much information and hence
limit the model capacity. More interestingly, the fact that C-C-T-T ≈ C-T-T-T indicates the for
processing low-level information, static local operations like convolution could be as capable as
adaptive global attention mechanism, while saving computation and memory usage substantially.
Finally, to decide between C-C-T-T and C-T-T-T, we conduct another transferability test3 — we
ﬁnetune the two JFT pre-trained models above on ImageNet-1K for 30 epochs and compare their
transfer performances. From Table 2, it turns out that C-C-T-T achieves a clearly better transfer
accuracy than C-T-T-T, despite the same pre-training performance.

3 Related Work

Convolutional network building blocks. Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) have been the dom-
inating neural architectures for many computer vision tasks. Traditionally, regular convolutions, such
as ResNet blocks [3], are popular in large-scale ConvNets; in contrast, depthwise convolutions [28]
are popular in mobile platforms due to its lower computational cost and smaller parameter size [27].
Recent works show that an improved inverted residual bottlenecks (MBConv [27, 35]), which is
built upon depthwise convolutions, can achieve both high accuracy and better efﬁciency [5, 19]. As
discussed in Section 2, due to the strong connection between MBConv and Transformer blocks , this
paper mostly employs MBConv as convolution building blocks.

3Rigorously speaking, this test examines not only the transferability but also the generalization.

With the key ingredients of self-attention, Transformers have
been widely adopted for neural language processing and speech understanding. As an early work,
stand-alone self-attention network [34] shows self-attention alone can work well for different vision
tasks, though with some practical difﬁculties. Recently, ViT [13] applies a vanilla Transformer
to ImageNet classiﬁcation, and achieves impressive results after pre-training on a large-scale JFT
dataset. However, ViT still largely lags behind state-of-the-art ConvNets when training data is limited.
Following that, many recent works have been focused on improving vision Transformers for data
efﬁciency and model efﬁciency. For a more comprehensive review of vision Transformers, we refer
readers to the dedicated surveys [36, 37].

Relative attention. Under the general name of relative attention, there have been various variants
in literature [30, 38, 39, 34, 40, 31]. Generally speaking, we can separate them into two categories:
(a) the input-dependent version where the extra relative attention score is a function of the input
states f (xi, xj, i − j), and (b) the input-independent version f (i − j). The variant in CoAtNet
belongs to the input-independent version, and is similar to the one used in T5 [31], but unlike T5, we
neither share the relative attention parameters across layers nor use the bucketing mechanism. As
a beneﬁt of the input independence, obtaining f (i − j) for all (i, j) pairs is computationally much
cheaper than the input-dependent version on TPU. In addition, at inference time, this only needs to be
computed once and cached for future use. A recent work [22] also utilizes such an input-independent
parameterization, but it restricts the receptive ﬁeld to a local window.

Combining convolution and self-attention. The idea of combining convolution and self-attention
for vision recognition is not new. A common approach is to augment the ConvNet backbone with
explicit self-attention or non-local modules [9, 10, 11, 12], or to replace certain convolution layers
with standard self-attention [11] or a more ﬂexible mix of linear attention and convolution [41]. While
self-attention usually improves the accuracy, they often come with extra computational cost and hence
are often regarded as an add-on to the ConvNets, similar to squeeze-and-excitation [42] module. In
comparison, after the success of ViT and ResNet-ViT [13], another popular line of research starts with
a Transformer backbone and tries to incorporate explicit convolution or some desirable properties of
convolution into the Transformer backbone [25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 43, 44].

While our work also belongs to this category, we show that our relative attention instantiation is a
natural mixture of depthwise convolution and content-based attention with minimum additional cost.
More importantly, starting from the perspectives of generalization and model capacity, we take a
systematic approach to the vertical layout design and show how and why different network stages
prefer different types of layers. Therefore, compared to models that simply use an off-the-shelf
ConvNet as the stem layer, such as ResNet-ViT [13], CoAtNet also scales the Convolution stage
(S2) when the overall size increases. On the other hand, compared to models employing local
attention [22, 21], CoAtNet consistently uses full attention for S3 & S4 to ensure the model capacity,
as S3 occupies the majority of the computation and parameters.

4 Experiments

In this section, we compare CoAtNet with previous results under comparable settings. For complete-
ness, all the hyper-parameters not mentioned here are included in Appendix A.2.

4.1 Experiment Setting

CoAtNet model family. To compare with existing models of different sizes, we also design a
family of CoAtNet models as summarized in Table 3. Overall, we always double the number of
channels from S1 to S4, while ensuring the width of the Stem S0 to be smaller or equal to that of S1.
Also, for simplicity, when increasing the depth of the network, we only scale the number of blocks in
S2 and S3.

Evaluation Protocol. Our experiments focus on image classiﬁcation. To evaluate the performance
of the model across different data sizes, we utilize three datasets of increasingly larger sizes, namely
ImageNet-1K (1.28M images), ImageNet-21K (12.7M images) and JFT (300M images). Following
previous works, we ﬁrst pre-train our models on each of the three datasets at resolution 224 for 300, 90
and 14 epochs respectively. Then, we ﬁnetune the pre-trained models on ImageNet-1K at the desired

always 4 and the expansion (shrink) rate for the SE is always 0.25.

resolutions for 30 epochs and obtain the corresponding evaluation accuracy. One exception is the
ImageNet-1K performance at resolution 224, which can be directly obtained at the end of pre-training.
Note that similar to other models utilizing Transformer blocks, directly evaluating models pre-trained
on ImageNet-1K at a larger resolution without ﬁnetuning usually leads to performance drop. Hence,
ﬁnetuning is always employed whenever input resolution changes.

Data Augmentation & Regularization.
In this work, we only consider two widely used data
augmentations, namely RandAugment [45] and MixUp [46], and three common techniques, including
stochastic depth [47], label smoothing [48] and weight decay [49], to regularize the model. Intuitively,
the speciﬁc hyper-parameters of the augmentation and regularization methods depend on model size
and data scale, where strong regularization is usually applied for larger models and smaller dataset.

Under the general principle, a complication under the current paradigm is how to adjust the regular-
ization for pre-training and ﬁnetuning as data size can change. Speciﬁcally, we have an interesting
observation that if a certain type of augmentation is entirely disabled during pre-training, simply
turning it on during ﬁne-tuning would most likely harm the performance rather than improving.
We conjecture this could be related to data distribution shift. As a result, for certain runs of the
proposed model, we deliberately apply RandAugment and stochastic depth of a small degree when
pre-training on the two larger datasets, ImageNet21-K and JFT. Although such regularization can
harm the pre-training metrics, this allows more versatile regularization and augmentation during
ﬁnetuning, leading to improved down-stream performances.

better than previous model with attention modules.

ImageNet-21K As we can see from Table 4 and Fig. 3, when ImageNet-21K is used for pre-
training, the advantage of CoAtNet becomes more obvious, substantially outperforming all previous
models. Notably, the best CoAtNet variant achieves a top-1 accuracy of 88.56%, matching the ViT-
H/14 performance of 88.55%, which requires pre-training the 2.3x larger ViT model on a 23x larger
proprietary weakly labeled dataset (JFT) for 2.2x more steps. This marks a dramatic improvement in
both data efﬁciency and computation efﬁciency.

JFT Finally, in Table 5, we further evaluate CoAtNet under the large-scale data regime with JFT-
300M and JFT-3B. Encouragingly, our CoAtNet-4 can almost match the best previous performance
with JFT-300M set by NFNet-F4+, while being 2x more efﬁcient in terms of both TPU training
time and parameter count. When we scale up the model to consume similar training resource as
NFNet-F4+, CoAtNet-5 reaches 89.77% on top-1 accuracy, outperforming previous results under
comparable settings.

Moreover, as we further push the training resource towards the level used by ViT-G/14 and utilize the
same JFT-3B dataset of an even larger size [26], with over 4x less computation, CoAtNet-6 is able to

4.3 Ablation Studies

In this section, we will ablate our design choices for CoAtNet.

Firstly, we study the importance of the relative attention from combining convolution and attention
into a single computation unit. Speciﬁcally, we compare two models, one with the relative attention
and the other without, under both the ImageNet-1K alone and ImageNet-21K transfer setting. As we
can see from Table 6, when only the ImageNet-1K is used, relative attention clearly outperforms the
standard attention, indicating a better generalization. In addition, under the ImageNet-21K transfer
setting, the relative attention variant achieves a substantially better transfer accuracy, despite their
very close pre-training performances. This suggests the main advantage of relative attention in visual
processing is not in higher capacity but in better generalization.

Secondly, as S2 with MBConv blocks and S3 with relative Transformer blocks occupy most of the
computation of the CoAtNet, a question to ask is how to split the computation between S2 (MBConv)
and S3 (Transformer) to achieve a good performance. In practice, it boils down to deciding the
number of blocks to have in each stage, which we will refer to as “layout” design. For this purpose,
we compare a few different layouts that we experimented with in Table 7.

• If we keep the total number of blocks in S2 and S3 ﬁxed and vary the number in each stage, we
observe that V0 is a sweet spot between V1 and V2. Basically, having more Transformer blocks in
S3 generally leads to better performance until the number of MBConv blocks in S2 is too small to
generalize well.

• To further evaluate whether the sweet spot also holds in the transfer setting, where a higher
capacity is often regarded more important, we further compare V0 and V1 under the ImageNet-
21K transferring to ImageNet-1K setup. Interestingly, despite that V1 and V0 have the same
performance during ImageNet-21K pre-training, the transfer accuracy of V1 clearly falls behind
V0. Again, this suggests the importance of convolution in achieving good transferability and
generalization.

Lastly, we study two choices of model details, namely the dimension of each attention (default to
32) head as well as the type of normalization (default to BatchNorm) used in MBConv blocks. From
Table 8, we can see increasing head size from 32 to 64 can slightly hurt performance, though it
actually improves the TPU speed by a signiﬁcant amount. In practice, this will be a quality-speed
trade-off one can make. On the other hand, BatchNorm and LayerNorm have almost the same
performance, while BatchNorm is 10 - 20% faster on TPU depending on the per-core batch size.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we systematically study the properties of convolutions and Transformers, which leads
to a principled way to combine them into a new family of models named CoAtNet. Extensive
experiments show that CoAtNet enjoys both good generalization like ConvNets and superior model
capacity like Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performances under different data sizes and
computation budgets.

Note that this paper currently focuses on ImageNet classiﬁcation for model development. However,
we believe our approach is applicable to broader applications like object detection and semantic
segmentation. We will leave them for future work.

A Appendix

A.1 Model Details

First of all, the overview of CoAtNet is illustrated in Fig. 4.

Figure 4: Overview of the proposed CoAtNet.

2D Relative Attention To implement the pre-norm version of relative attention in Eqn. 3 for 2D
images of size [H×W ], for each head, we create a trainable parameter P of size [(2H−1)×(2W −1)],
as the maximum distance is 2H − 1 and 2W − 1 respectively. Then, for two spatial locations
(i, j) and (i(cid:48), j(cid:48)), the corresponding relative bias is Pi−i(cid:48)+H,j−j(cid:48)+W under 1-based indexing. For
implementation, we need to index H 2W 2 elements from the [(2H − 1) × (2W − 1)] matrix. On TPU,
we utilize two einsums, along the height and width axis respectively, to index the relative bias with
complexity O(HW (H + W )), which is strictly subsumed by the O(H 2W 2D) attention complexity.
On GPUs, the indexing can be done more efﬁciently with gather, which only requires memory
access. Note that, at inference time, indexing the H 2W 2 elements from the [(2H − 1) × (2W − 1)]
matrix can be pre-computed and cached to further increase the throughput.

When ﬁnetuned on a larger resolution, we simply use bi-linear interpolation to increase the size
[(2H − 1) × (2W − 1)] to the desired size [(2H (cid:48) − 1) × (2W (cid:48) − 1)] for any H (cid:48) > H and W (cid:48) > W .

Pre-Activation To promote homogeneity in the model architecture, we consistently use pre-
activation structure [50] for both the MBConv and the Transformer block, i.e.,

x ← x + Module (Norm(x)) ,

where Module denotes the MBConv, Self-Attention or FFN module, while Norm corresponds to
BatchNorm for MBConv and LayerNorm for Self-Attention and FFN. We have experimented with
using LayerNorm in the MBConv block, which achieves the same performance while being signif-
icantly slower on our accelerator (TPU). In general, we recommend whichever is faster on your
device. Following the same spirit, Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs) [51] is used as the activation
function in both the MBConv blocks and Transformer blocks.

Down-Sampling For the ﬁrst block inside each stage from S1 to S4, down-sampling is performed
independently for the residual branch and the identity branch. Speciﬁcally, for the Transformer block,
the standard max pooling of stride 2 is directly applied to the input states of both branches of the
self-attention module, similar to Funnel Transformer [52]. Also, a channel projection is applied to
the identity branch to enlarge the hidden size. Hence, the down-sampling self-attention module can
be expressed as

x ← Proj(Pool(x)) + Attention (Pool(Norm(x))) .
As for the MBConv block, the down-sampling in the residual branch is instead achieved by using a
stride-2 convolution to the normalized inputs, i.e.,

(4)

x ← Proj(Pool(x)) + Conv (DepthConv (Conv (Norm(x), stride = 2)))) .

(5)

This is different from the standard MBConv where the down-sampling is done by applying stride-
2 depthwise convolution to the inverted bottleneck hidden states. We later found using stride-2
depthwise convolution is helpful but slower when model is small but not so much when model scales,
as shown in Table 9. Hence, if not mentioned otherwise, numbers reported in the main text uses
the down-sampling implementation in Eqn. (5). In practice, this could be yet another quality-speed
trade-off one can tweak for smaller models.

Classiﬁcation head Instead of adding an additional <cls> token as in ViT to perform classiﬁcation,
we apply global average pooling to the last-stage output to get the representation for simplicity.

A.2 Hyper-Parameters

Table 10: Hyper-parameters used in the main experiments. The slash sign “ / ” is used to separate
the different hyper-parameters used for various CoAtNet model sizes. (cid:5): For ﬁnetuning the slightly
larger CoAtNet-3, RandAugment of 2, 20 is used. †: RandAugment of 2, 5 is applied to the PT-RA
variants of CoAtNet-4 in Table 14.

The hyper-parameters used for the main experiments presented in Section 4 are summarized in Table
10.

The model size of CoAtNet-5 used in the JFT experiment is summarized in Table 11. Different from
the standard CoAtNet models in Table 3, we set the size of each attention head to 64 rather than 32
for CoAtNet-5, as this achieves a better speed-performance trade-off as discussed in Section 4.3.

For CoAtNet-6 and CoAtNet-7, to reduce the memory consumption, we move 2/3 of the MBConv
blocks of S2 into S3 and double its hidden dimension. While this modiﬁcation does not change the

15

complexity in terms of FLOPs, this will reduce the activation related memory usage of these MBConv
blocks by half, which enables us to build a larger model. With this adjustment, the S3 becomes a
stage of mixed block types and hidden dimensions. In addition, we increase the attention head size to
128 further to boost the speed-performance trade-off. The speciﬁc sizes are summarized in Table 12.
Basically, CoAtNet-6 and CoAtNet-7 share the same depth but differ in width.
